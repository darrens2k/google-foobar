# Solution Strategy
### A high level overview of the strategy/concepts used within my solution.

### Utilized Concepts:
* Helper Functions
* Nested Loops


The function 'solution' generates a string of length 5 containing all prime numbers, and takes an integer n as input, n represents the prime number that the string begins upon. It begins with the first prime number, then iteratively finds the next prime number using a helper function. The function returns a string of length 5 starting from the nth prime number and continually adds the next prime numbers until the string has reached a length of 5.

When the function is called with the argument 3, it returns a string of length 5 consisting of the next prime numbers after the 3rd prime.
