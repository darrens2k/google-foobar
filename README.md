# My Google Foobar Journey

This is a repository to log my journey through the levels of the google foobar challenge. Each folder contains my notes for that level. Typically I will include a description of the problem, a description of my solution and then the code I have written for my solution. Note that the description of my solution is not intended to explain how to solve the problem, it is there to just describe the concepts that I utilized while solving the problem.

*If you are currently working your way through the challege I urge you to not look at this repository, I am sure that if you sit and apply yourself you will be able to figure the problem you are facing out. If you truly feel that you need some guidance, take a look at the readme files I have created, they contain a high level description of my solution. But I highly advise against reviewing my code if you are currently completing the challenge.*
