# Solution Strategy
### A high level overview of the strategy/concepts used within my solution.

### Utilized Concepts:
* Absorbing Markov Chains
* Manual Matrix Arithmetic

This function utilizes and exploits the concept of Absorbing Markov Chains to quickly solve this problem. An absorbing markov chain is simply one that is guaranteed to end up in an absorbing, or terminal, state.

Here are some video that I refernced to build my solution:
