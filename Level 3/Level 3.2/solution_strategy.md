# Solution Strategy
### A high level overview of the strategy/concepts used within my solution.

### Utilized Concepts:
* Matrix Manipulation
* BFS

This admittedly is actually not the solution I had submitted to google foobar, I had accidentally deleted that file but it was an implementation that used BFS to find the shortest path. If I find some free time during the coming months I will return to this repository and rewrite this solution using BFS. 

I believe that the solution in its current state is not entirely correct and will not always find the shortest path.
